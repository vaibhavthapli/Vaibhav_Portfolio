# [Project 1 : Iris Species prediction](https://github.com/vaibhavthapli/Iris-Species-prediction)

* The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems,  and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
* I was able to get the model to predict the species with 97% accuracy after using SVC.
